			<h5>President</h5>
			<p>Home Mountain: Snowshoe, West Virginia</p>
			<p>"I am from Stafford Va, and I am a senior here at JMU. I have only been snowboarding for 3 seasons now, because I did not learn how until freshman year when i taught myself. No one in my family skis or boards, so I was never exposed to it as a kid. I came to JMU hoping to try new things, and that is exactly what I did. Around this same time, I joined Boarderline with a few friends just because it looked cool, and was hoping to make more friends along the way. It quickly became much more than that. Boarderline has since become not only my JMU family,  but also where I spend most of my time. Being able to make new friends and spend time doing something new that I loved, has been such a great experience. I have made tons of memories through Boarderline so far and I am super excited to be the president during my 4th year in the club!!!"</p>
			<p>"A fun fact about me is 3 out of 5 of my concussions are already from snowboarding"</p>

I’ve been snowboarding for about seven years but this club gave me the opportunity to ride way more in a season. I’ve made great memories and even better friends in this club and joining is one of the best things i’ve ever done."</p>

			<p>"I'm Mallory but I am better known as Beemus. I am a junior and this is my third year in Boarderline. Before I got into JMU, I wanted to join a Ski and Snowboard club. I found so much more than a Ski and Snowboard Club within Boarderline. I found a family, community, and a team. BL has given me so many opportunities to improve my boarding skills and has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. Boarderline has been the source of my best memories in college."</p>

I joined boarderline my freshman year and have loved every minute of it since. From tailgates at football games to Colorado trips, I have countless memories with my boarderline family that I will never forget. Boarderline has provided me with some of the best times of my life as well as the best people, and I know that it’ll do the same for others."</p>

Immediately I had a good group of friends and it made the transition into college much easier. I can happily say that I consider these friends as family now. This club has also given me the opportunity to consistently get on the slopes and I got drastically better at snowboarding in a year. I enjoy going to the gym, I am an exec member of the men’s club volleyball team, and listening to music is one of my favorite pastimes."</p>

As an upcoming 5th year I can truly say I finally found my place here at JMU. "</p>

I joined Boarderline as a sophomore because I had a lot of friends in it and I wanted to make more friends to snowboard with. I ended up meeting a ton of super cool people, some of which became my closest friends ever. I love filming skate and snow video which is why I ran for this position so if you want any clips filmed let me know.</p>
